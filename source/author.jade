With the holiday mood setting in, I decided this is going to be one of the lighter, fun blog posts that’s simply about lovely posts and videos that makes us feel warm, like sipping on a hot cup of cocoa.

                            p Your favorite thing about Chipotle might be their guacamole, but what I like best about the QSR brand is their social media strategy. In this blog post, I’ve examined Chipotle’s habits across four social networks, their content, how their performance compares to the industry, how they handled a PR crisis and key lessons other brands can apply to their own strategy.

Global brand, social presence across multiple networks, dedicated pages based on geographies, and moreover, different pages for different models - imagine all the data I had to go through.

                                p Remember when people thought buying Likes on Facebook was a good idea? Gone are the days when teams with the bigger budgets created the most engaging social media content. I’m not saying sponsoring content doesn’t make a difference at all, but I am saying money isn’t the only solution anymore to engage an audience.
