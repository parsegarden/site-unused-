                                    p A version of this article first appeared on Social Times on February 5th, 2016. This article includes data up to February 8th so the numbers have changed slightly.<br>Can there be any bigger linchpin of a brand’s marketing calendar than the Super Bowl? An event that is as much about the advertising as it is about the game. For Super Bowl 50, CBS is charging $5 million for a 30-second spot, up from $2.5 million 10 years ago.<br><br>On social media, the uptick in brands creating Super Bowl content has been nothing short of incredible. This year, Unmetric tracked over 44,000 unique pieces of Super Bowl content published by brands before and during the Super Bowl. That's up from 30,000 pieces of content we tracked in 2015. On game day alone, brands published over 21,500 pieces of content<br><br>Take a step back and think about that for a second. After what must be an exhausting six weeks of creating Super Bowl related content, content creators still needed enough inspiration within them to publish 21,500 more unique pieces of content on game day - more than they’ve published in the build up to the game!<br><br>Here’s how the total amount of content published on social media around the Super Bowl has changed over the years. Unsurprisingly, the week before game day sees a frantic amount of content being published.

                                    p When you think of lingerie brands on social media, chances are that the first brand you think of is Victoria's Secret. And with good reason. The iconic lingerie brand, which enjoys the largest fan base, has been one of the most prolific social media content producers, using its army of Angels and a sound content strategy to stay on top of everyone's mind.<br><br>Aerie by American Eagle produced the highest number of posts in the time analyzed - the last quarter of 2015. However it was Victoria's Secret again that received the most social interactions - Likes, Comments and Shares.

                                    p Some say Christmas is the most wonderful time of the year (well, 
                                    a(href="#") Andy Williams 
                                    | does, any way), others would say it's summer time (unless you're

                                    |, of course). For me, the best time of year is February. Yes, I am British and no, I don't understand this Football that the Americans call it, but by gum I do love the adverts and the marketing madness that surrounds the Super Bowl.<br><br>Another reason I love this time of the year is that it is a great excuse for the entire marketing team to sit in the big conference room and watch YouTube non-stop all day in the name of 'work'.<br><br>This year there are 44 different brands advertising during the Super Bowl. We watched all their ads and then dug into the Unmetric app to dig up data and insights behind the marketing strategies employed by each brand.

In this blog post, I’ve examined Chipotle’s habits across four social networks, their content, how their performance compares to the industry, how they handled a PR crisis and key lessons other brands can apply to their own strategy.
